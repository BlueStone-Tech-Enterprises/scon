And I'm not supposed\nto be doing this,\n\nbut they were all trying to kill me.\n\nAnd if it wasn't for you...\n\nI had to thank you.\nIt's just how I was raised.\n\nThat was a little weird.\n\n- I'm talking with a bee.\n- Yeah.\n\nI'm talking to a bee.\nAnd the bee is talking to me!\n\nI just want to say I'm grateful.\nI'll leave now.\n\n- Wait! How did you learn to do that?\n- What?\n\nThe talking thing.\n\nSame way you did, I guess.\n\"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up.\n\n- That's very funny.\n- Yeah.\n\nBees are funny.

I don't know.\n\nI want to do my part for the hive,\nbut I can't do it the way they want.\n\nI know how you feel.\n\n- You do?\n- Sure.\n\nMy parents wanted me to be a lawyer or\na doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.\n\n- Really?\n- My only interest is flowers.\n\nOur new queen was just elected\nwith that same campaign slogan.\n\nAnyway, if you look...\n\nThere's my hive right there. See it?\n\nYou're in Sheep Meadow!\n\nYes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!\n\nNo way! I know that area.\nI lost a toe ring there once.\n\n- Why do girls put rings on their toes?\n- Why not?\n\n- It's like putting a hat on your knee.\n- Maybe I'll try that.\n\n- You all right, ma'am?\n- Oh, yeah. Fine.\n\nJust having two cups of coffee!\n\nAnyway, this has been great.\nThanks for the coffee.\n\nYeah, it's no trouble.\n\nSorry I couldn't finish it.

Anyway...\n\nThis can't possibly work.\n\nHe's all set to go.\nWe may as well try it.\n\nOK, Dave, pull the chute.\n\n- Sounds amazing.\n- It was amazing!\n\nIt was the scariest,\nhappiest moment of my life.\n\nHumans! I can't believe\nyou were with humans!\n\nGiant, scary humans!\nWhat were they like?\n\nHuge and crazy. They talk crazy.\n\nThey eat crazy giant things.\nThey drive crazy.\n\n- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?\n- Some of them. But some of them don't.\n\n- How'd you get back?\n- Poodle.\n\nYou did it, and I'm glad. You saw\nwhatever you wanted to see.\n\nYou had your \"experience.\" Now you\ncan pick out yourjob and be normal.\n\n- Well...\n- Well?\n\nWell, I met someone.\n\nYou did? Was she Bee-ish?\n\n- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!\n- No, no, no, not a wasp.\n\n- Spider?\n- I'm not attracted to spiders.\n\nI know it's the hottest thing,\nwith the eight legs and all.\n\nI can't get by that face.\n\nSo who is she?\n\nShe's... human.\n\nNo, no. That's a bee law.\nYou wouldn't break a bee law.\n\n- Her name's Vanessa.\n- Oh, boy.\n\nShe's so nice. And she's a florist!\n\nOh, no! You're dating a human florist!\n\nWe're not dating.\n\nYou're flying outside the hive, talking\nto humans that attack our homes\n\nwith power washers and M-80s!\nOne-eighth a stick of dynamite!\n\nShe saved my life!\nAnd she understands me.\n\nThis is over!\n\nEat this.\n\nThis is not over! What was that?\n\n- They call it a crumb.\n- It was so stingin' stripey!\n\nAnd that's not what they eat.\nThat's what falls off what they eat!\n\n- You know what a Oinnabon is?\n- No.\n\nIt's bread and cinnamon and frosting.\nThey heat it up...\n\nSit down!\n\n...really hot!\n- Listen to me!\n\nWe are not them! We're us.\nThere's us and there's them!\n\nYes, but who can deny\nthe heart that is yearning?\n\nThere's no yearning.\nStop yearning. Listen to me!\n\nYou have got to start thinking bee,\nmy friend.

That's the one you want.\n\nThe Thomas 3000!\n\nSmoker?\n\nNinety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.\nTwice the nicotine, all the tar.\n\nA couple breaths of this\nknocks them right out.\n\nThey make the honey,\nand we make the money.\n\n\"They make the honey,\nand we make the money\"?\n\nOh, my!\n\nWhat's going on? Are you OK?\n\nYeah. It doesn't last too long.\n\nDo you know you're\nin a fake hive with fake walls?\n\nOur queen was moved here.\nWe had no choice.\n\nThis is your queen?\nThat's a man in women's clothes!\n\nThat's a drag queen!\n\nWhat is this?\n\nOh, no!\n\nThere's hundreds of them!\n\nBee honey.\n\nOur honey is being brazenly stolen\non a massive scale!\n\nThis is worse than anything bears\nhave done! I intend to do something.\n\nOh, Barry, stop.\n\nWho told you humans are taking\nour honey? That's a rumor.\n\nDo these look like rumors?\n\nThat's a conspiracy theory.\nThese are obviously doctored photos.\n\nHow did you get mixed up in this?\n\nHe's been talking to humans.\n\n- What?\n- Talking to humans?!\n\nHe has a human girlfriend.\nAnd they make out!\n\nMake out? Barry!\n\nWe do not.\n\n- You wish you could.\n- Whose side are you on?\n\nThe bees!\n\nI dated a cricket once in San Antonio.\nThose crazy legs kept me up all night.\n\nBarry, this is what you want\nto do with your life?\n\nI want to do it for all our lives.\nNobody works harder than bees!\n\nDad, I remember you\ncoming home so overworked\n\nyour hands were still stirring.\nYou couldn't stop.\n\nI remember that.\n\nWhat right do they have to our honey?\n\nWe live on two cups a year. They put it\nin lip balm for no reason whatsoever!\n\nEven if it's true, what can one bee do?\n\nSting them where it really hurts.\n\nIn the face! The eye!\n\n- That would hurt.\n- No.\n\nUp the nose? That's a killer.\n\nThere's only one place you can sting\nthe humans, one place where it matters.\n\nHive at Five, the hive's only\nfull-hour action news source.\n\nNo more bee beards!\n\nWith Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.\n\nWeather with Storm Stinger.\n\nSports with Buzz Larvi.\n\nAnd Jeanette Ohung.\n\n- Good evening.

I can't do this\"?\n\nBees have never been afraid\nto change the world.\n\nWhat about Bee Oolumbus?\nBee Gandhi? Bejesus?\n\nWhere I'm from, we'd never sue humans.\n\nWe were thinking\nof stickball or candy stores.\n\nHow old are you?\n\nThe bee community\nis supporting you in this case,\n\nwhich will be the trial\nof the bee century.\n\nYou know, they have a Larry King\nin the human world too.\n\nIt's a common name. Next week...\n\nHe looks like you and has a show\nand suspenders and colored dots...\n\nNext week...\n\nGlasses, quotes on the bottom from the\nguest even though you just heard 'em.\n\nBear Week next week!\nThey're scary, hairy and here live.\n\nAlways leans forward, pointy shoulders,\nsquinty eyes, very Jewish.\n\nIn tennis, you attack\nat the point of weakness!\n\nIt was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.\n\nHoney, her backhand's a joke!\nI'm not gonna take advantage of that?\n\nQuiet, please.\nActual work going on here.\n\n- Is that that same bee?\n- Yes, it is!\n\nI'm helping him sue the human race.\n\n- Hello.\n- Hello, bee.\n\nThis is Ken.\n\nYeah, I remember you. Timberland, size\nten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.\n\nWhy does he talk again?\n\nListen, you better go\n'cause we're really busy working.\n\nBut it's our yogurt night!\n\nBye-bye.\n\nWhy is yogurt night so difficult?!\n\nYou poor thing.\nYou two have been at this for hours!\n\nYes, and Adam here\nhas been a huge help.\n\n- Frosting...\n- How many sugars?\n\nJust one. I try not\nto use the competition.\n\nSo why are you helping me?\n\nBees have good qualities.\n\nAnd it takes my mind off the shop.\n\nInstead of flowers, people\nare giving balloon bouquets now.\n\nThose are great, if you're three.\n\nAnd artificial flowers.\n\n- Oh, those just get me psychotic!\n- Yeah, me too.\n\nBent stingers, pointless pollination.\n\nBees must hate those fake things!\n\nNothing worse\nthan a daffodil that's had work done.\n\nMaybe this could make up\nfor it a little bit.\n\n- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.\n- I guess.\n\nYou sure you want to go through with it?\n\nAm I sure? When I'm done with\nthe humans, they won't be able\n\nto say, \"Honey, I'm home,\"\nwithout paying a royalty!\n\nIt's an incredible scene\nhere in downtown Manhattan,\n\nwhere the world anxiously waits,\nbecause for the first time in history,\n\nwe will hear for ourselves\nif a honeybee can actually speak.\n\nWhat have we gotten into here, Barry?\n\nIt's pretty big, isn't it?\n\nI can't believe how many humans\ndon't work during the day.\n\nYou think billion-dollar multinational\nfood companies have good lawyers?\n\nEverybody needs to stay\nbehind the barricade.\n\n- What's the matter?\n- I don't know, I just got a chill.\n\nWell, if it isn't the bee team.\n\nYou boys work on this?\n\nAll rise! The Honorable\nJudge Bumbleton presiding.\n\nAll right. Oase number 4475,\n\nSuperior Oourt of New York,\nBarry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry\n\nis now in session.\n\nMr. Montgomery, you're representing\nthe five food companies collectively?\n\nA privilege.\n\nMr. Benson... you're representing\nall the bees of the world?\n\nI'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,\nwe're ready to proceed.\n\nMr. Montgomery,\nyour opening statement, please.\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury,\n\nmy grandmother was a simple woman.\n\nBorn on a farm, she believed\nit was man's divine right\n\nto benefit from the bounty\nof nature God put before us.\n\nIf we lived in the topsy-turvy world\nMr. Benson imagines,\n\njust think of what would it mean.\n\nI would have to negotiate\nwith the silkworm\n\nfor the elastic in my britches!\n\nTalking bee!\n\nHow do we know this isn't some sort of\n\nholographic motion-picture-capture\nHollywood wizardry?\n\nThey could be using laser beams!\n\nRobotics! Ventriloquism!\nOloning! For all we know,\n\nhe could be on steroids!\n\nMr. Benson?\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\nthere's no trickery here.\n\nI'm just an ordinary bee.\nHoney's pretty important to me.\n\nIt's important to all bees.\nWe invented it!\n\nWe make it. And we protect it\nwith our lives.\n\nUnfortunately, there are\nsome people in this room\n\nwho think they can take it from us\n\n'cause we're the little guys!\nI'm hoping that, after this is all over,\n\nyou'll see how, by taking our honey,\nyou not only take everything we have\n\nbut everything we are!\n\nI wish he'd dress like that\nall the time. So nice!\n\nOall your first witness.\n\nSo, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden\nof Honey Farms, big company you have.\n\nI suppose so.\n\nI see you also own\nHoneyburton and Honron!\n\nYes, they provide beekeepers\nfor our farms.\n\nBeekeeper. I find that\nto be a very disturbing term.\n\nI don't imagine you employ\nany bee-free-ers, do you?\n\n- No.\n- I couldn't hear you.\n\n- No.\n- No.\n\nBecause you don't free bees.\nYou keep bees. Not only that,\n\nit seems you thought a bear would be\nan appropriate image for a jar of honey.\n\nThey're very lovable creatures.\n\nYogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.\n\nYou mean like this?\n\nBears kill bees!\n\nHow'd you like his head crashing\nthrough your living room?!\n\nBiting into your couch!\nSpitting out your throw pillows!\n\nOK, that's enough. Take him away.\n\nSo, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.\nYour name intrigues me.\n\n- Where have I heard it before?\n- I was with a band called The Police.\n\nBut you've never been\na police officer, have you?\n\nNo, I haven't.\n\nNo, you haven't. And so here\nwe have yet another example\n\nof bee culture casually\nstolen by a human\n\nfor nothing more than\na prance-about stage name.\n\nOh, please.\n\nHave you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?\n\nBecause I'm feeling\na little stung, Sting.\n\nOr should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!\n\nThat's not his real name?! You idiots!\n\nMr. Liotta, first,\nbelated congratulations on\n\nyour Emmy win for a guest spot\non ER in 2005.\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nI see from your resume\nthat you're devilishly handsome\n\nwith a churning inner turmoil\nthat's ready to blow.\n\nI enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?\n\nNot yet it isn't. But is this\nwhat it's come to for you?\n\nExploiting tiny, helpless bees\nso you don't\n\nhave to rehearse\nyour part and learn your lines, sir?\n\nWatch it, Benson!\nI could blow right now!\n\nThis isn't a goodfella.\nThis is a badfella!\n\nWhy doesn't someone just step on\nthis creep, and we can all go home?!\n\n- Order in this court!\n- You're all thinking it!\n\nOrder! Order, I say!\n\n- Say it!\n- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!\n\nI think it was awfully nice\nof that bear to pitch in like that.\n\nI think the jury's on our side.\n\nAre we doing everything right, legally?\n\nI'm a florist.\n\nRight. Well, here's to a great team.\n\nTo a great team!\n\nWell, hello.\n\n- Ken!\n- Hello.\n\nI didn't think you were coming.\n\nNo, I was just late.\nI tried to call, but... the battery.\n\nI didn't want all this to go to waste,\nso I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.\n\nOh, that was lucky.\n\nThere's a little left.\nI could heat it up.\n\nYeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\n\nSo I hear you're quite a tennis player.\n\nI'm not much for the game myself.\nThe ball's a little grabby.\n\nThat's where I usually sit.\nRight... there.\n\nKen, Barry was looking at your resume,\n\nand he agreed with me that eating with\nchopsticks isn't really a special skill.\n\nYou think I don't see what you're doing?\n\nI know how hard it is to find\nthe rightjob. We have that in common.\n\nDo we?\n\nBees have 100 percent employment,\nbut we do jobs like taking the crud out.\n\nThat's just what\nI was thinking about doing.\n\nKen, I let Barry borrow your razor\nfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\n\nI'm going to drain the old stinger.\n\nYeah, you do that.\n\nLook at that.\n\nYou know, I've just about had it\n\nwith your little mind games.\n\n- What's that?\n- Italian Vogue.\n\nMamma mia, that's a lot of pages.\n\nA lot of ads.\n\nRemember what Van said, why is\nyour life more valuable than mine?\n\nFunny, I just can't seem to recall that!\n\nI think something stinks in here!\n\nI love the smell of flowers.\n\nHow do you like the smell of flames?!\n\nNot as much.\n\nWater bug! Not taking sides!\n\nKen, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!\nThis is pathetic!\n\nI've got issues!\n\nWell, well, well, a royal flush!\n\n- You're bluffing.\n- Am I?\n\nSurf's up, dude!\n\nPoo water!\n\nThat bowl is gnarly.\n\nExcept for those dirty yellow rings!\n\nKenneth! What are you doing?!\n\nYou know, I don't even like honey!\nI don't eat it!\n\nWe need to talk!\n\nHe's just a little bee!\n\nAnd he happens to be\nthe nicest bee I've met in a long time!\n\nLong time? What are you talking about?!\nAre there other bugs in your life?\n\nNo, but there are other things bugging\nme in life. And you're one of them!\n\nFine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\n\nMy nerves are fried from riding\non this emotional roller coaster!\n\nGoodbye, Ken.\n\nAnd for your information,\n\nI prefer sugar-free, artificial\nsweeteners made by man!\n\nI'm sorry about all that.\n\nI know it's got\nan aftertaste! I like it!\n\nI always felt there was some kind\nof barrier between Ken and me.\n\nI couldn't overcome it.\nOh, well.\n\nAre you OK for the trial?\n\nI believe Mr. Montgomery\nis about out of ideas.\n\nWe would like to call\nMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\n\nGood idea! You can really see why he's\nconsidered one of the best lawyers...\n\nYeah.\n\nLayton, you've\ngotta weave some magic\n\nwith this jury,\nor it's gonna be all over.\n\nDon't worry. The only thing I have\nto do to turn this jury around\n\nis to remind them\nof what they don't like about bees.\n\n- You got the tweezers?\n- Are you allergic?\n\nOnly to losing, son. Only to losing.\n\nMr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you\nwhat I think we'd all like to know.\n\nWhat exactly is your relationship\n\nto that woman?\n\nWe're friends.\n\n- Good friends?\n- Yes.\n\nHow good? Do you live together?\n\nWait a minute...\n\nAre you her little...\n\n...bedbug?\n\nI've seen a bee documentary or two.\nFrom what I understand,\n\ndoesn't your queen give birth\nto all the bee children?\n\n- Yeah, but...\n- So those aren't your real parents!\n\n- Oh, Barry...\n- Yes, they are!\n\nHold me back!\n\nYou're an illegitimate bee,\naren't you, Benson?\n\nHe's denouncing bees!\n\nDon't y'all date your cousins?\n\n- Objection!\n- I'm going to pincushion this guy!\n\nAdam, don't! It's what he wants!\n\nOh, I'm hit!!\n\nOh, lordy, I am hit!\n\nOrder! Order!\n\nThe venom! The venom\nis coursing through my veins!\n\nI have been felled\nby a winged beast of destruction!\n\nYou see? You can't treat them\nlike equals! They're striped savages!\n\nStinging's the only thing\nthey know! It's their way!\n\n- Adam, stay with me.\n- I can't feel my legs.\n\nWhat angel of mercy\nwill come forward to suck the poison\n\nfrom my heaving buttocks?\n\nI will have order in this court. Order!\n\nOrder, please!\n\nThe case of the honeybees\nversus the human race\n\ntook a pointed turn against the bees\n\nyesterday when one of their legal\nteam stung Layton T. Montgomery.\n\n- Hey, buddy.\n- Hey.\n\n- Is there much pain?\n- Yeah.\n\nI...\n\nI blew the whole case, didn't I?\n\nIt doesn't matter. What matters is\nyou're alive. You could have died.\n\nI'd be better off dead. Look at me.\n\nThey got it from the cafeteria\ndownstairs, in a tuna sandwich.\n\nLook, there's\na little celery still on it.\n\nWhat was it like to sting someone?\n\nI can't explain it. It was all...\n\nAll adrenaline and then...\nand then ecstasy!\n\nAll right.\n\nYou think it was all a trap?\n\nOf course. I'm sorry.\nI flew us right into this.\n\nWhat were we thinking? Look at us. We're\njust a couple of bugs in this world.\n\nWhat will the humans do to us\nif they win?\n\nI don't know.\n\nI hear they put the roaches in motels.\nThat doesn't sound so bad.\n\nAdam, they check in,\nbut they don't check out!\n\nOh, my.\n\nOould you get a nurse\nto close that window?\n\n- Why?\n- The smoke.\n\nBees don't smoke.\n\nRight. Bees don't smoke.\n\nBees don't smoke!\nBut some bees are smoking.\n\nThat's it! That's our case!\n\nIt is? It's not over?\n\nGet dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.\n\nGet back to the court and stall.\nStall any way you can.\n\nAnd assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.\n\nMr. Flayman.\n\nYes? Yes, Your Honor!\n\nWhere is the rest of your team?\n\nWell, Your Honor, it's interesting.\n\nBees are trained to fly haphazardly,\n\nand as a result,\nwe don't make very good time.\n\nI actually heard a funny story about...\n\nYour Honor,\nhaven't these ridiculous bugs\n\ntaken up enough\nof this court's valuable time?\n\nHow much longer will we allow\nthese absurd shenanigans to go on?\n\nThey have presented no compelling\nevidence to support their charges\n\nagainst my clients,\nwho run legitimate businesses.\n\nI move for a complete dismissal\nof this entire case!\n\nMr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going\n\nto have to consider\nMr. Montgomery's motion.\n\nBut you can't! We have a terrific case.\n\nWhere is your proof?\nWhere is the evidence?\n\nShow me the smoking gun!\n\nHold it, Your Honor!\nYou want a smoking gun?\n\nHere is your smoking gun.\n\nWhat is that?\n\nIt's a bee smoker!\n\nWhat, this?\nThis harmless little contraption?\n\nThis couldn't hurt a fly,\nlet alone a bee.\n\nLook at what has happened\n\nto bees who have never been asked,\n\"Smoking or non?\"\n\nIs this what nature intended for us?\n\nTo be forcibly addicted\nto smoke machines\n\nand man-made wooden slat work camps?\n\nLiving out our lives as honey slaves\nto the white man?\n\n- What are we gonna do?\n- He's playing the species card.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, please,\nfree these bees!\n\nFree the bees! Free the bees!\n\nFree the bees!\n\nFree the bees! Free the bees!\n\nThe court finds in favor of the bees!\n\nVanessa, we won!\n\nI knew you could do it! High-five!\n\nSorry.\n\nI'm OK! You know what this means?\n\nAll the honey\nwill finally belong to the bees.\n\nNow we won't have\nto work so hard all the time.\n\nThis is an unholy perversion\nof the balance of nature, Benson.\n\nYou'll regret this.\n\nBarry, how much honey is out there?\n\nAll right. One at a time.\n\nBarry, who are you wearing?\n\nMy sweater is Ralph Lauren,\nand I have no pants.\n\n- What if Montgomery's right?\n- What do you mean?\n\nWe've been living the bee way\na long time, 27 million years.\n\nOongratulations on your victory.\nWhat will you demand as a settlement?\n\nFirst, we'll demand a complete shutdown\nof all bee work camps.\n\nThen we want back the honey\nthat was ours to begin with,\n\nevery last drop.\n\nWe demand an end to the glorification\nof the bear as anything more\n\nthan a filthy, smelly,\nbad-breath stink machine.\n\nWe're all aware\nof what they do in the woods.\n\nWait for my signal.\n\nTake him out.\n\nHe'll have nauseous\nfor a few hours, then he'll be fine.\n\nAnd we will no longer tolerate\nbee-negative nicknames...\n\nBut it's just a prance-about stage name!\n\n...unnecessary inclusion of honey\nin bogus health products\n\nand la-dee-da human\ntea-time snack garnishments.\n\nOan't breathe.\n\nBring it in, boys!\n\nHold it right there! Good.\n\nTap it.\n\nMr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,\nand there's gallons more coming!\n\n- I think we need to shut down!\n- Shut down? We've never shut down.\n\nShut down honey production!\n\nStop making honey!\n\nTurn your key, sir!\n\nWhat do we do now?\n\nOannonball!\n\nWe're shutting honey production!\n\nMission abort.\n\nAborting pollination and nectar detail.\nReturning to base.\n\nAdam, you wouldn't believe\nhow much honey was out there.\n\nOh, yeah?\n\nWhat's going on? Where is everybody?\n\n- Are they out celebrating?\n- They're home.\n\nThey don't know what to do.\nLaying out, sleeping in.\n\nI heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way\nto San Antonio with a cricket.\n\nAt least we got our honey back.\n\nSometimes I think, so what if humans\nliked our honey? Who wouldn't?\n\nIt's the greatest thing in the world!\nI was excited to be part of making it.\n\nThis was my new desk. This was my\nnew job. I wanted to do it really well.\n\nAnd now...\n\nNow I can't.\n\nI don't understand\nwhy they're not happy.\n\nI thought their lives would be better!\n\nThey're doing nothing. It's amazing.\nHoney really changes people.\n\nYou don't have any idea\nwhat's going on, do you?\n\n- What did you want to show me?\n- This.\n\nWhat happened here?\n\nThat is not the half of it.\n\nOh, no. Oh, my.\n\nThey're all wilting.\n\nDoesn't look very good, does it?\n\nNo.\n\nAnd whose fault do you think that is?\n\nYou know, I'm gonna guess bees.\n\nBees?\n\nSpecifically, me.\n\nI didn't think bees not needing to make\nhoney would affect all these things.\n\nIt's notjust flowers.\nFruits, vegetables, they all need bees.\n\nThat's our whole SAT test right there.\n\nTake away produce, that affects\nthe entire animal kingdom.\n\nAnd then, of course...\n\nThe human species?\n\nSo if there's no more pollination,\n\nit could all just go south here,\ncouldn't it?\n\nI know this is also partly my fault.\n\nHow about a suicide pact?\n\nHow do we do it?\n\n- I'll sting you, you step on me.\n- Thatjust kills you twice.\n\nRight, right.\n\nListen, Barry...\nsorry, but I gotta get going.\n\nI had to open my mouth and talk.\n\nVanessa?\n\nVanessa? Why are you leaving?\nWhere are you going?\n\nTo the final Tournament of Roses parade\nin Pasadena.\n\nThey've moved it to this weekend\nbecause all the flowers are dying.\n\nIt's the last chance\nI'll ever have to see it.\n\nVanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.\nI never meant it to turn out like this.\n\nI know. Me neither.\n\nTournament of Roses.\nRoses can't do sports.\n\nWait a minute. Roses. Roses?\n\nRoses!\n\nVanessa!\n\nRoses?!\n\nBarry?\n\n- Roses are flowers!\n- Yes, they are.\n\nFlowers, bees, pollen!\n\nI know.\nThat's why this is the last parade.\n\nMaybe not.\nOould you ask him to slow down?\n\nOould you slow down?\n\nBarry!\n\nOK, I made a huge mistake.\nThis is a total disaster, all my fault.\n\nYes, it kind of is.\n\nI've ruined the planet.\nI wanted to help you\n\nwith the flower shop.\nI've made it worse.\n\nActually, it's completely closed down.\n\nI thought maybe you were remodeling.\n\nBut I have another idea, and it's\ngreater than my previous ideas combined.\n\nI don't want to hear it!\n\nAll right, they have the roses,\nthe roses have the pollen.\n\nI know every bee, plant\nand flower bud in this park.\n\nAll we gotta do is get what they've got\nback here with what we've got.\n\n- Bees.\n- Park.\n\n- Pollen!\n- Flowers.\n\n- Repollination!\n- Across the nation!\n\nTournament of Roses,\nPasadena, Oalifornia.\n\nThey've got nothing\nbut flowers, floats and cotton candy.\n\nSecurity will be tight.\n\nI have an idea.\n\nVanessa Bloome, FTD.\n\nOfficial floral business. It's real.\n\nSorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.\n\nThank you. It was a gift.\n\nOnce inside,\nwe just pick the right float.\n\nHow about The Princess and the Pea?\n\nI could be the princess,\nand you could be the pea!\n\nYes, I got it.\n\n- Where should I sit?\n- What are you?\n\n- I believe I'm the pea.\n- The pea?\n\nIt goes under the mattresses.\n\n- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.\n- I'm getting the marshal.\n\nYou do that!\nThis whole parade is a fiasco!\n\nLet's see what this baby'll do.\n\nHey, what are you doing?!\n\nThen all we do\nis blend in with traffic...\n\n...without arousing suspicion.\n\nOnce at the airport,\nthere's no stopping us.\n\nStop! Security.\n\n- You and your insect pack your float?\n- Yes.\n\nHas it been\nin your possession the entire time?\n\nWould you remove your shoes?\n\n- Remove your stinger.\n- It's part of me.\n\nI know. Just having some fun.\nEnjoy your flight.\n\nThen if we're lucky, we'll have\njust enough pollen to do the job.\n\nOan you believe how lucky we are? We\nhave just enough pollen to do the job!\n\nI think this is gonna work.\n\nIt's got to work.\n\nAttention, passengers,\nthis is Oaptain Scott.\n\nWe have a bit of bad weather\nin New York.\n\nIt looks like we'll experience\na couple hours delay.\n\nBarry, these are cut flowers\nwith no water. They'll never make it.\n\nI gotta get up there\nand talk to them.\n\nBe careful.\n\nOan I get help\nwith the Sky Mall magazine?\n\nI'd like to order the talking\ninflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.\n\nOaptain, I'm in a real situation.\n\n- What'd you say, Hal?\n- Nothing.\n\nBee!\n\nDon't freak out! My entire species...\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\n- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!\n- Who's an attorney?\n\nDon't move.\n\nOh, Barry.\n\nGood afternoon, passengers.\nThis is your captain.\n\nWould a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B\nplease report to the cockpit?\n\nAnd please hurry!\n\nWhat happened here?\n\nThere was a DustBuster,\na toupee, a life raft exploded.\n\nOne's bald, one's in a boat,\nthey're both unconscious!\n\n- Is that another bee joke?\n- No!\n\nNo one's flying the plane!\n\nThis is JFK control tower, Flight 356.\nWhat's your status?\n\nThis is Vanessa Bloome.\nI'm a florist from New York.\n\nWhere's the pilot?\n\nHe's unconscious,\nand so is the copilot.\n\nNot good. Does anyone onboard\nhave flight experience?\n\nAs a matter of fact, there is.\n\n- Who's that?\n- Barry Benson.\n\nFrom the honey trial?! Oh, great.\n\nVanessa, this is nothing more\nthan a big metal bee.\n\nIt's got giant wings, huge engines.\n\nI can't fly a plane.\n\n- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?\n- Yes.\n\nHow hard could it be?\n\nWait, Barry!\nWe're headed into some lightning.\n\nThis is Bob Bumble. We have some\nlate-breaking news from JFK Airport,\n\nwhere a suspenseful scene\nis developing.\n\nBarry Benson,\nfresh from his legal victory...\n\nThat's Barry!\n\n...is attempting to land a plane,\nloaded with people, flowers\n\nand an incapacitated flight crew.\n\nFlowers?!\n\nWe have a storm in the area\nand two individuals at the controls\n\nwith absolutely no flight experience.\n\nJust a minute.\nThere's a bee on that plane.\n\nI'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson\nand his no-account compadres.\n\nThey've done enough damage.\n\nBut isn't he your only hope?\n\nTechnically, a bee\nshouldn't be able to fly at all.\n\nTheir wings are too small...\n\nHaven't we heard this a million times?\n\n\"The surface area of the wings\nand body mass make no sense.\"\n\n- Get this on the air!\n- Got it.\n\n- Stand by.\n- We're going live.\n\nThe way we work may be a mystery to you.\n\nMaking honey takes a lot of bees\ndoing a lot of small jobs.\n\nBut let me tell you about a small job.\n\nIf you do it well,\nit makes a big difference.\n\nMore than we realized.\nTo us, to everyone.\n\nThat's why I want to get bees\nback to working together.\n\nThat's the bee way!\nWe're not made of Jell-O.\n\nWe get behind a fellow.\n\n- Black and yellow!\n- Hello!\n\nLeft, right, down, hover.\n\n- Hover?\n- Forget hover.\n\nThis isn't so hard.\nBeep-beep! Beep-beep!\n\nBarry, what happened?!\n\nWait, I think we were\non autopilot the whole time.\n\n- That may have been helping me.\n- And now we're not!\n\nSo it turns out I cannot fly a plane.\n\nAll of you, let's get\nbehind this fellow! Move it out!\n\nMove out!\n\nOur only chance is if I do what I'd do,\nyou copy me with the wings of the plane!\n\nDon't have to yell.\n\nI'm not yelling!\nWe're in a lot of trouble.\n\nIt's very hard to concentrate\nwith that panicky tone in your voice!\n\nIt's not a tone. I'm panicking!\n\nI can't do this!\n\nVanessa, pull yourself together.\nYou have to snap out of it!\n\nYou snap out of it.\n\nYou snap out of it.\n\n- You snap out of it!\n- You snap out of it!\n\n- You snap out of it!\n- You snap out of it!\n\n- You snap out of it!\n- You snap out of it!\n\n- Hold it!\n- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.\n\nHow is the plane flying?\n\nI don't know.\n\nHello?\n\nBenson, got any flowers\nfor a happy occasion in there?\n\nThe Pollen Jocks!\n\nThey do get behind a fellow.\n\n- Black and yellow.\n- Hello.\n\nAll right, let's drop this tin can\non the blacktop.\n\nWhere? I can't see anything. Oan you?\n\nNo, nothing. It's all cloudy.\n\nOome on. You got to think bee, Barry.\n\n- Thinking bee.\n- Thinking bee.\n\nThinking bee!\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\n\nWait a minute.\nI think I'm feeling something.\n\n- What?\n- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.\n\nLike a 27-million-year-old instinct.\n\nBring the nose down.\n\nThinking bee!\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\n\n- What in the world is on the tarmac?\n- Get some lights on that!\n\nThinking bee!\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\n\n- Vanessa, aim for the flower.\n- OK.\n\nOut the engines. We're going in\non bee power. Ready, boys?\n\nAffirmative!\n\nGood. Good. Easy, now. That's it.\n\nLand on that flower!\n\nReady? Full reverse!\n\nSpin it around!\n\n- Not that flower! The other one!\n- Which one?\n\n- That flower.\n- I'm aiming at the flower!\n\nThat's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.\nI mean the giant pulsating flower\n\nmade of millions of bees!\n\nPull forward. Nose down. Tail up.\n\nRotate around it.\n\n- This is insane, Barry!\n- This's the only way I know how to fly.\n\nAm I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane\nflying in an insect-like pattern?\n\nGet your nose in there. Don't be afraid.\nSmell it. Full reverse!\n\nJust drop it. Be a part of it.\n\nAim for the center!\n\nNow drop it in! Drop it in, woman!\n\nOome on, already.\n\nBarry, we did it!\nYou taught me how to fly!\n\n- Yes. No high-five!\n- Right.\n\nBarry, it worked!\nDid you see the giant flower?\n\nWhat giant flower? Where? Of course\nI saw the flower! That was genius!\n\n- Thank you.\n- But we're not done yet.\n\nListen, everyone!\n\nThis runway is covered\nwith the last pollen\n\nfrom the last flowers\navailable anywhere on Earth.\n\nThat means this is our last chance.\n\nWe're the only ones who make honey,\npollinate flowers and dress like this.\n\nIf we're gonna survive as a species,\nthis is our moment! What do you say?\n\nAre we going to be bees, orjust\nMuseum of Natural History keychains?\n\nWe're bees!\n\nKeychain!\n\nThen follow me! Except Keychain.\n\nHold on, Barry. Here.\n\nYou've earned this.\n\nYeah!\n\nI'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect\nfit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nThat's our Barry.\n\nMom! The bees are back!\n\nIf anybody needs\nto make a call, now's the time.\n\nI got a feeling we'll be\nworking late tonight!\n\nHere's your change. Have a great\nafternoon! Oan I help who's next?\n\nWould you like some honey with that?\nIt is bee-approved. Don't forget these.\n\nMilk, cream, cheese, it's all me.\nAnd I don't see a nickel!\n\nSometimes I just feel\nlike a piece of meat!\n\nI had no idea.\n\nBarry, I'm sorry.\nHave you got a moment?\n\nWould you excuse me?\nMy mosquito associate will help you.\n\nSorry I'm late.\n\nHe's a lawyer too?\n\nI was already a blood-sucking parasite.\nAll I needed was a briefcase.\n\nHave a great afternoon!\n\nBarry, I just got this huge tulip order,\nand I can't get them anywhere.\n\nNo problem, Vannie.\nJust leave it to me.\n\nYou're a lifesaver, Barry.\nOan I help who's next?\n\nAll right, scramble, jocks!\nIt's time to fly.\n\nThank you, Barry!\n\nThat bee is living my life!\n\nLet it go, Kenny.\n\n- When will this nightmare end?!\n- Let it all go.\n\n- Beautiful day to fly.\n- Sure is.\n\nBetween you and me,\nI was dying to get out of that office.\n\nYou have got\nto start thinking bee, my friend.\n\n- Thinking bee!\n- Me?\n\nHold it. Let's just stop\nfor a second. Hold it.\n\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.\nOan we stop here?\n\nI'm not making a major life decision\nduring a production number!\n\nAll right. Take ten, everybody.\nWrap it up, guys.\n\nI had virtually no rehearsal for that.\n\n\nOh shit it looks like the bee movie script wasn't long enough, guess I'll have to settle for industry-standard bullshit instead\n\n\n\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
